# ASC
This API Spec Coverage tool is meant to be be used to show how much of API is covered by test run by inspecting captured HAR files. Currently WIP, 2 prototypes have been made, initial one and more sophisticated one.

To run first prototype, clone repository and run with `python3 ASC.py petstore.json testhar.har` to show example output.

To run second prototype, clone and run with `python3 ASC_V2.py petstore.json har3har.har`
